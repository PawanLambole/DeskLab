# How electron-updater uses this:
# 1. Compares version (1.0.1 vs installed version)
# 2. If newer, downloads from URL
# 3. Verifies with SHA512 hash
# 4. Installs the update

# For GitHub Releases, electron-builder generates this automatically
# You just upload both files to your release:
#   - DeskLab Setup 1.0.1.exe
#   - latest.yml
